# School_District_Analysis
Python-Anaconda

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to aggregate data and analyze them for purposeful use in school district. In fact, having access to 
every students' math and reading scores as well as various information on school funding sources can help us with this data analysis at both
the school and district level. 
Undoubtedly, the work done in this analysis will be effective in improving the performance of the schools and will assist the school board 
in making decissions regarding the school budget and priorities. Therefore, the data must be treated in such a way to provide the most protect for students 
with at most confitiality.

## Resources
- Data Sources: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: [Python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Module: pandas, numpy

## Summary
The Analysis of the election shows that:
1. The total votes casted for the election was 369,711.

2. The number of candidates running in this election is three with the following names:
   - Candidate #1: Charles Casper Stockham
   - Candidate #2: Diana DeGette
   - Candidate #3: Raymon Anthony Doane

3. The candidate results were:
   - Candidate #1 recieved 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
   - Candidate #2 recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
   - Candidate #3 recieved 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.

5. The comprehensive analysis of this election can be extended to larger projects such as gatherings at national and international levels. 
By enlarging the loops of iteration, creating nested loops and using conditional statements on influential factors, wider analyzes will be possible.

## Challenge Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to reinforce the Python programming insight by using VBA background. In fact, we performed a simulation for obtaining the winner county of what
has been done before. We used Python as well as Visual studio code softwares for excecuting our script. 
Python, while simple, is very practical and intuitive, thus it can be used as an effective computational tool for macro-analysis.

Preliminary information is available in this election that is related to the list of candidates and their total votes along with 
the winner of the election based on the highest percentage of the votes. In order to complete the rest of the information related to 
this project, determining the share of participating of each county and selecting the winning county has a significient role in clarifying for the audiences. 
Therefore, the purpose of this analysis audit is to calculate the voter turnout and the percentage of votes of each county in order to
determining the county with the highest turnout.

## Challenge Summary
In fact, the presented challenge is an example of hundreds of samples that we encounter in the real world. Problem analysis in the form of a flowchart
and pseudo-code gives us an extensive information.
Knowing what we want to do and what our goal is supposed to be, is the most important step in starting this analysis, and then advancing the problem in the direction of goal
using important tools such as Python is the next step in achieving the result of the data analysis.

In this challenge, the election results of three counties were examined, the percentage of the vote and the number of votes are shown as
