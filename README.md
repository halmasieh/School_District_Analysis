# School_District_Analysis


## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to aggregate data and analyze them for purposeful use in school district. In fact, having access to 
every students' math and reading scores as well as various information on school funding sources can help us with this data analysis at both
the school and district level. 
Undoubtedly, the work done in this analysis will be effective in improving the performance of the schools and will assist the school board 
in making decissions regarding the school budget and priorities. Therefore, the data must be treated in such a way to provide the most protect for students 
with at most confitiality.

## Resources
- Data Sources: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: [Python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Module: pandas, numpy

## Results
1. How is the district summary affected? 

As seen in the following DataFrame: 

![here](https://github.com/halmasieh/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/district_summary.PNG)

   - The total budget for 15 covered schools is specified with a subtlety of 39170 students.
   - The average grades of the math and reading courses are specified.
   - The percentage of passing math and reading are reported.



2. How is the school summary affected?

As seen in the following DataFrame: 

![here](https://github.com/halmasieh/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/school_summary.PNG)

   - Information on the total number of students as well as school type is available by school name.
   - The budget allocated to each school and each student is known.
   - The average math score and reading score ia available long with the passing percentage of these courses.  
   
   
   
 3. How does replacing the ninth-graders' math and reading scores affect High School's performance relative to the other schools?

As seen in the following DataFrame: 

![here](https://github.com/halmasieh/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/THS-9th.PNG)

   - The values related to the math and reading scores of ninth-graders have unknown values.
   - lack of the ninth-graders' math and reading scores affects the school average as well as the percentage of passing.
   
 
 
4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  Information on math score and reading score is highlighted below.

  - Scores by school spending
  After replacing all the math and reading scores from the ninth grade at Thomas High School with NaN has not changed.

## Summary
After replacing the values of reading and math scores with "NaN"s, the values of the "School Type", "Total Students", "Total School Budget" and "Per Student Budget"
have not changed, and have been influential in associated with math and reading scores
- " % Passing Math " has moved to 93.19.
- " % Passing reading " has moved to 97.02
- " % Overall Passing " has moved to 90.63
